[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) is an artificial intelligence dialogue system developed by **OpenAI**, based on the **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** large language model technology. It can understand and generate natural language text, answer questions, engage in conversations, assist with writing, programming, and more. Since its launch in **November 2022**, ChatGPT has quickly become one of the most well-known AI chat assistants worldwide.

* Below are the complete steps to use ChatGPT on **Windows**.

### 1. Install the Network Proxy Tool v2rayN

According to the latest information, ChatGPT is **banned or inaccessible in about 20 countries** as of 2025.
These countries include: **China, Russia, North Korea, Iran, Syria, Cuba, Belarus, Venezuela, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Central African Republic, Chad, Eritrea, Libya, South Sudan, Yemen**, and others.

**Main reasons for the ban include:**

1. **Information control and censorship:**
   China blocks ChatGPT for reasons of information control, fearing it could spread content that contradicts the official narrative. ChatGPT does not comply with China’s strict censorship laws and is therefore blocked by the “Great Firewall.”

2. **Geopolitical factors:**
   Countries such as Russia, Iran, and Syria distrust the U.S. and worry that OpenAI’s chatbot technology could be used to spread political instability or encourage regime change.
