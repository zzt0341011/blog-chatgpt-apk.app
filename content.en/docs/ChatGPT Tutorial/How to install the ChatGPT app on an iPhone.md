[ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) is a chatbot powered by OpenAI’s large language model (LLM). It can communicate with users in a highly natural and human-like way, answering a wide range of questions. Beyond simple conversation, it can perform various text-based tasks. ChatGPT is trained on massive datasets, and its core mechanism is predicting the most reasonable next word in a sentence — allowing it to generate smooth, coherent, and information-rich responses.

## 1. Getting a Foreign Apple ID

* Since the ChatGPT app is not available in the Chinese Apple App Store, you must log in with a **foreign Apple ID**, such as a **U.S. Apple ID**, to download it.
* Therefore, the first step is to obtain a foreign Apple ID.
* The following guide explains how to download **Shadowrocket**, purchase a VPN (proxy) subscription, obtain a U.S. Apple ID, and then download and use the **ChatGPT** app.
